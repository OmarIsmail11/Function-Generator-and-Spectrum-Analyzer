## About
This project implements a Function Generator and a Spectrum Analyzer using LabVIEW, providing a visual and interactive environment to generate and analyze signals in real-time.

It can be used to generate customizable analog waveforms (e.g., sine, square, triangle) and analyze the frequency components of input signals utilizing FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). Displays the waveform on both time and frequency domains.

This was the final project of the EECS100 - Laboratory Course.

## Features
### 1. Function Generator

- Generate signals with adjustable waveform type (Sine, Square, Triangle, etc.), frequency, amplitude, noise and offset.
- Real-time waveform visualization and manipulation using the oscilliscope knobs.

### 2. Spectrum Analyzer
- Display frequency spectrum, peak frequencies, and magnitude vs frequency plot.

## Collaborators
- Amr Ashraf
- Ahmed Mohammed
- Omar Ahmed Reda
